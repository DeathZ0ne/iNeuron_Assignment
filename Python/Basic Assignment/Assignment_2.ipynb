    "#### 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "**Ans** The two values of Boolean data type is `True` and `False`. \n",
    "To write we use capital T and F and with the rest of the word in the lowercase.\n",

    "**Ans** For equal to, `==`is used.\n",
    "For assignment, `=` is used.\n",
